Problem Solving (Sample Medium Questions)

1.Kth Largest Element in an Array

Question:

       Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

      Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

      Can you solve it without sorting?

Example:1

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
Example:2

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
 

2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Question:

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 

3. Reverse Integer

Question:

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
 

4. Rotate Array

Question:

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Question:

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

6. Maximum Subarray

Question:

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.
 

7. Transpose of a matrix.

Description:

Given a matrix A, return the transpose of A.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the row and column indices of the matrix.

Input:

A list of lists A representing the matrix. The length of A is m and the length of each list inside A is n. (1 ≤ m, n ≤ 1000)
Each element of the matrix is an integer in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
Output:

Return the transpose of the matrix A.
Example:

Input:
[
 [1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]
]

Output:
[
 [1,4,7],
 [2,5,8],
 [3,6,9]
]
 

8. Search a 2D Matrix

Question:

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Example  1:

1	3	5	7
10	11	16	20
23	30	34	60
 

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], 
target = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

1	3	5	7
10	11	16	20
23	30	34	60
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], 
target = 13
Output: false
